# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

A study guide for pre-work bootcamp student. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

My motivation to create this study guide is to maintain an organized documentation of the learnings and work that I create for the duration of the UCLA bootcamp. I built this project to apply my understanding of the module and learn the foundations of working with the command line, VSC, and GitHub. This exercise helped me address the lack of application I have had in building and deploying projects.I learned how to push and pull code from my local enviornment to the cloud on GitHub.

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide can be used to refer back to lessons and notes that will continue to get updated as the bootcamp course continues. This study guide also serves as an area to practie skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git as it is the first project that I have created and can continue to improve.
